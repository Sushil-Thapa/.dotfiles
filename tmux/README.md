## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. **Use at your own risk!**

### Software Installations
- Installing [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

### Setup Using Git

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/.dotfiles`)

To install, `cd` into your local `.dotfiles` repository and Run `install.sh`or script below. It will create necessary symlinks into your required locations with stow.

```bash
stow tmux
```
